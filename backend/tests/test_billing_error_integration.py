"""Integration tests for BillingError exception handler with GitHub issue filing.

These tests verify the complete flow:
1. BillingError exception is raised in an API endpoint
2. FastAPI exception handler catches it
3. HTTP 503 response is returned to client
4. GitHub issue is filed in background (async, non-blocking)
5. GitHub API failures are handled gracefully

Dependencies (must be implemented first):
- BillingError exception class (issue #114)
- FastAPI exception handler for BillingError (issue #123)
- GitHubIssueService with file_billing_error_issue method (issues #108, #112)
- Background task infrastructure (issue #113)
- Integration of GitHub filing into handler (issue #124)
