## Tricky Areas Requiring Extra Attention

1. **Message splitting timing** - Ensure delays feel natural, not too fast or slow
2. **Concurrent thinker responses** - Race conditions when multiple thinkers respond
3. **WebSocket state management** - Connection/disconnection edge cases
4. **Mention detection** - Avoid false positives (common words matching names)
5. **Extended thinking streaming** - Token accumulation and display throttling
6. **Conversation switching** - Clean up state from previous conversation
